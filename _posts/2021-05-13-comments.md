Starting with 1.1, Steve supports [Staticman](https://staticman.net)-powered comments, and provides initial settings from our own `staticman.yml` config file. You can create your own settings at any time, but keep in mind that Steve looks for the following fields when submitting comments:

- `name`
- `email`
- `website`
- `message`

[Follow these instructions](https://staticman.net/docs/getting-started.html) to set up your Staticman instance.

You can also customize your comments' section and submit form adding the `site.comments` object in your `_config.yml`:

```yaml
comments:
  title: Comments
  form_title: New Comment
  date_format: "%b %e, %Y @ %l:%M %P"
  staticman_endpoint: # Get yours on <https://staticman.net>
  notice: |+ # Accepts Markdown
    Please be nice in the comments.

    Comments are moderated, so it can take a while for your's to show up.

    Also, you can use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).
