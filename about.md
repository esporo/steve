title: About this theme
---

Steve is a charming and fun blog theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the static site generator. It's developed by [@arthrfrts](https://github.com/arthrfrts) to be used on the [Esporo](https://esporo.net/) websites &mdash; but feel free to use it in any project you may find it fitting.

Steve is made using these amazing Jekyll plugins:

- [jekyll-feed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed)
- [jekyll-seo-map](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag)
- [jekyll-sitemap](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sitemap)
- [jekyll-paginate](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-paginate)
- [jekyll-archives](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-archives)
